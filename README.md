## What is Drink Please?

Drink Please (formerly known as bzzer.io) is a fun project started while playing the [Lord of the Rings Drinking Game](https://psycatgames.com/magazine/party-games/the-lord-of-the-rings) ("drink at certain scenes" version) during the [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns). As much fun as it is yelling "DRINK" on Discord, needing to unmute every time became quite the buzzkill (pun intended :wink: ). This project was conceived as an attempt to fix this problem... You can simply smash any key on your keyboard to alert all of your friends to drink! Virtual drinking games are now just as satisfying as drinking games used to be when we were all face to face.
